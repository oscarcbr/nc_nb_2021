#These dataset were obtain from van Groningen et al. paper 2017 (https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3899#an1). "mRNA profiling of the phenotypically divergent subclones SH-EP2 and SH-SY5Y derived from the SK-N-SH cell line7 identified similar differences, with SH-EP2 cells conforming to MES-type cells and SH-SY5Y cells resembling ADRN-type cells. Using all four isogenic cell line pairs, we established a 485-gene MES mRNA signature and a 369-gene ADRN mRNA signature (Supplementary Table 2)." This Supplementary table 2 was used to obtained the list for the ADR and MES signatures and saved in the file "MES_ADR_sgntr.tsv". The list was modified to fit GRCh38.p12 names with the following changes: 
'ADRBK2' to 'GRK3', 'C4orf32' to 'FAM241A', 'C7orf55' to 'FMC1', 'CYR61' to 'CCN1', 'FAM46A' to 'TENT5A', 'FAM60A' to 'SINHCAF', 'HMP19' to 'NSG2', 'HN1' to 'JPT1', 'KDELC2' to 'POGLUT3', 'KIAA1462' to 'JCAD', 'KIRREL' to 'KIRREL1', 'LHFP' to 'LHFPL6', 'LOC100507194' to None, 'LOC101928409' to None, 'MRC2' to 'AC080038.1', 'NOTCH2NL' to 'NOTCH2NLA', 'PTRF' to 'CAVIN1', 'SPRY4-IT1' to None.
