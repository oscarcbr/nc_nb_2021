#Tirosh et al. 2016 analyzed 4645 sc from 19 patients, profiling malignant immune, stromal and endothelial cells. This file was obtained from the supplementary material Table S5 that included core signature of cell cycle specific genes and also genes expressed in cycling malignant cells from both low-cycling and high-cycling tumors. This table was reformated and saved in "melanomaCllCycl_hg38.tsv", and the gene names were double check for congruency with Human genes (GRCh38.p12) with the following changes:  FAM64A for PIMREG, HN1 for JPT1, KIAA0101 for PCLAF, KIF23 for AC027237.1, MLF1IP for CENPU, and TMEM194A for NEMP1.
